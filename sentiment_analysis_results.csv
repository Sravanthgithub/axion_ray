"Per usual the Pixel Pro did not disappoint! Camera quality is top tier, it charges quickly and the battery life lasts at least a day and a half honestly. The design of the phone is sleek and slender which gives it a modern day feel and it’s extremely lightweight and easy to hold. The value for this phone is fair considering I-phones costs are way higher I feel you aren’t compromising on quality even with the more affordable price. It’s extremely user friendly especially for business if you use google as your main operating system. Highly Recommend! Its overall use is great and affordability really helps as well!",0.9805,0.25,0.017,0.733,Positive
"This Google Pixel 9 Pro has blown my mind. I’m not normally an Android user but this Google phone performance is top notch. It is extremely fast, sleek, holds a long charge and takes amazing photos. I would recommend this phone to anyone that has a preference to an android and to be honest even iPhone users. There are so many amazing features on this device a couple include 8k video,night sight video and video boost. This phone is definitely amazing quality.",0.9878,0.321,0.0,0.679,Positive
"I’ve been using the Google Pixel 9 Pro for a few days now, and I have to say, I’m really impressed! The performance is smooth and snappy—no lag at all, even when I have tons of apps open. It honestly feels just as fast as the iPhone, which I wasn’t expecting.
The battery life is also pretty solid. I’m easily getting through a full day with normal use, though I think the iPhone might have a bit of an edge if you’re a heavy user. As for durability, the Pixel 9 Pro feels well-built and sturdy in hand, but I still feel like my old iPhone could handle drops a little better, so I’ll probably keep a case on it. The camera quality is where the Pixel 9 Pro really shines! The photos are sharp, colors are beautiful, and it’s especially good in low light. Google’s software really does some magic here—it’s honestly as good as, if not better than, the iPhone in a lot of situations. One thing I appreciate is the user interface. The Android experience on the Pixel 9 Pro feels super clean and customizable. I know some people prefer iOS for its simplicity, but I actually enjoy the flexibility of Android. Overall, if you’re thinking of trying something new or switching from iPhone, the Pixel 9 Pro is definitely worth a look.",0.996,0.259,0.019,0.722,Positive
"I've been a fan of Google Pixel. I've been using Pixel 8 pro and it's been working well. The Pixel 9 pro is faster and has better performance than the pixel 8 pro. The battery life is a little bit better on the pixel 9 pro. The frame is glossy metal and it feels more premium than the pixel 8 pro. The camera has been improved even though there's still some space for improvement. Overall, it's a good phone with tons of customization if you're into it and a tech guru.",0.9531,0.204,0.0,0.796,Positive

The durability of the phone is awesome. It is something different than my one plus phone. The battery life lasts longer than my previous phones. The performance of the phone is faster and more reliable. The camera quality is 10x's better than an iPhone. The user interface is pretty straightforward. The only thing I do not like is that they don't have the SD memory card slot. Yet I can deal with it.,0.8438,0.129,0.027,0.845,Positive
This phones camera is so beautiful and clear! The capacity of things this phone can do will have me talking forever! It’s nice and durable and the battery life is everything ! I literally only had to charge this phone once in 72hours. The front camera is very clear and high tech. You can def tell from its high quality engineering that it’s built to last!

"The Google pixel 9 pro comes with some unique features.  

 You can setup a bedtime routine and it will let you know when you cough or snore at night. 

There is a battery management where it tracks what apps you use and helps to conserve battery life. 

You can merge 2 pictures together if you are missing 1 person behind the camera and want them to join in after. 

There is a temperature app where you can sense temperature around you, on food,  or yourself.  It's not the most accurate,  but is pretty useful to estimate. 

Great slim design.  Nice vivid colors and sound.",0.9659,0.194,0.014,0.792,Positive
"OMG I am absolutely flabbergasted at this Google Pixel 9 pro in Obsidian. I am still pinching myself what an amazing phone I was given to to test out. I wanna talk about some specifications about this awesome hardware . It's 6.3 inches long, the OLED display is bright and vibrant. It has a front facing and rear facing camera that have 50 megapixels so the images come out super sharp and clear. The cameras also ultra wide, which are great for scenic pictures if you like taking photos of the outdoors as much as I do.it was released in 2024 so this is a newest model of the Google Pixel 9 Pro. It's got a great weight to it without being heavy. It has a gorgeous large screen and like I mentioned the camera is stunning. The design is sleek. The quality is excellent. It has a very premium feel to it. It does come in four colors beside the obsidian one that I received, which is a beautiful, dark, grayish black. It's in nice polished aluminum frame that you would definitely want to get a case to protect From scratches. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a fantastic smartphone. I am sure the performance will not disappoint. I would recommend this to my friends and family.",0.9965,0.283,0.009,0.708,Positive
"I was very excited about the Google Pixel 9 Pro😊 Everything about it feels well-designed. But let me just be upfront this phone isn’t super light, so if you prefer really lightweight phones, you might notice it right away. For me it wasn’t a dealbreaker, but it’s something to keep in mind. The design is absolutely gorgeous. It’s got a sleek aluminum frame and a frosted glass back that feels smooth and expensive. The camera, though, is pretty big, so if you’re not used to having a larger camera module on the back, it might take a little getting used to. At first, I kept noticing it when I held the phone, but now I don’t even think about it. The screen is great!! It’s bright, colorful, and super sharp. The phone is also really sensitive to the touch, which I absolutely love. Performance-wise, it’s fast. It handles everything I throw at it, from switching between apps to watching YouTube and even gaming a little. I’m not a tech expert, but I’ve had no issues with speed or lag it just works smoothly. Setting it up was also ridiculously easy. I connected it to my Google account, and all my apps, contacts, and even my photos backed up and loaded onto the phone almost instantly. The cameras are amazing! The main camera is 50 megapixels, and it takes the clearest, sharpest photos I’ve seen on any phone. There’s also an ultrawide lens for group shots or landscapes and a telephoto lens that lets you zoom in without losing quality. The camera setup is big, like I mentioned earlier, but it’s totally worth it for the photo quality. The battery life is solid. It gets through a full day easily. Charging is pretty quick, though not the fastest compared to other brands. Still I never feel like I’m stuck waiting for it to charge. Durability is pretty decent, too. The glass back feels premium, but it might be prone to cracks if dropped, so I’d definitely recommend getting a case. It’s not super light, the camera bump might take some getting used to, and the glass back means you’ll probably want a case but everything else makes up for it. This phone is fast, the cameras are stunning, the setup is ridiculously easy, and it’s packed with features that actually feel useful. I am happy with this upgrade!😊",0.9985,0.229,0.031,0.74,Positive
"I received this product from influenster and Google for my honest review. This is my first time receiving an electronic device from influenster and I'm excited. The Google Pixel 9 Pro is amazing. Super easy to transfer my info into the new phone and like always with a new phone. The fun part is to get to know it and it's new features, well the pixel 9 pro has Gemini and amazing camera.

"The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a fantastic smartphone that offers a compelling blend of cutting-edge technology and user-friendly features. Its stunning display delivers vibrant colors and sharp details, making it a joy to use. The powerful camera system captures stunning photos and videos, even in low-light conditions. The phone's performance is smooth and efficient, thanks to Google's Tensor G2 chip. While the battery life could be better, the overall experience is impressive. If you're looking for a phone that offers a unique blend of hardware and software, the Pixel 9 Pro is definitely worth considering.",0.9874,0.329,0.0,0.671,Positive

Wow, Google outdid themselves and the quality and specs are amazing with the camera, front and back,  apps, processor,  speed, battery, everything a Mobile phone needs. I will switch my phone to this and cant wait.  Its also not bulky either,  I love it,  thanks again!",0.9538,0.273,0.06,0.668,Positive
Very nice phone. The set up was helpful and easy. So many new google features included that it’s almost overwhelming. Excellent camera quality. I love the feel and weight of the phone as well.

"Nice phone and very easy to use. It took a while (20-30 mins) to transfer my photos and videos over but I have a lot, so it’s understandable. Great camera quality with a few different settings to choose from . The pictures literally came out crystal clear!",0.9292,0.265,0.0,0.735,Positive
"This phone is very nice, I’m really pleased with it. It has excellent camera quality, much better than my iPhone 14 Pro Max!! My AirPods connect to this phone. Has great battery life, overall great phone and I love it!!",0.9808,0.453,0.0,0.547,Positive
"I’ve been using the Pixel 9 Pro for about a month, and overall, it’s been a great experience. The camera is hands down the best feature – photos are sharp, colors are vibrant, and the Magic Editor makes editing so easy. The new AI features like “Add Me” in group photos are super useful too.

The screen is beautiful, bright, and easy to use outdoors, though the low PWM rate can be uncomfortable for long use in dim lighting. The battery life is okay – it lasts a full day with light to moderate use, but heavy tasks like gaming or navigation drain it pretty quickly.

Performance-wise, it’s smooth for everyday apps, but the Tensor G4 isn’t as fast as Snapdragon chips in some competitors. It handles multitasking well but can lag slightly during intensive gaming sessions.

I had some minor issues with the in-display fingerprint sensor, especially with a screen protector, but face unlock works reliably. The 7-year update guarantee is a big plus, and the overall software experience is clean and intuitive.

If you’re into photography and AI features, the Pixel 9 Pro is worth it. Just keep in mind the battery and performance trade-offs!",0.9855,0.199,0.03,0.772,Positive
This is an excellent phone. The picture quality is amazing. The phone is little heavier than expected but amazing. Love the way my pictures are.,0.9497,0.429,0.0,0.571,Positive
This phone is great! It is nice and slim the case i pit on it makes it thicker. And protects the fabulous camera it comes with when not taking pictures. Fits in my hand great. The battery life is also phenomenal as I do a lot of video chatting and watching tutorials. I'm an android person so this is great. My issue and the reason I gave 4 stars is that the 3 button bottom controls I cannot change the order of. I like the far right button to be my back button. I am most certainly most used to it being there and have in the past been able to rearrange these buttons but was unable to do that on this phone. Everythinfg else about this phone is great!,0.9695,0.186,0.0,0.814,Positive
"I liked the phone at first sight. It feels very nice in the hands. I will describe it in details. The Pixel 9 Pro has a stunning display, making it perfect for watching videos, browsing the web, and gaming. The screen is vibrant and colorful, with deep blacks and excellent contrast. The phone's design is sleek and premium, with a metal frame that feels solid in the hand.
The camera on the Pixel 9 Pro is arguably its strongest feature. The camera app is intuitive and easy to use. The results are stunning, with crisp and detailed photos that rival those taken with professional cameras. The camera also excels in low-light conditions, capturing images with minimal noise and excellent color accuracy. 
The Pixel 9 Pro is powered by a large battery and a fast charging system that can top up the battery in the short time. The phone is incredibly fast and responsive, with seamless performance even when running demanding apps and games.
The Google Pixel 9 Pro is an exceptional smartphone that's sure to please even the most demanding users. Its exceptional camera, lightning-fast performance, and sleek design  undoubtedly allow us to occupy a leading position in the market. Due to the excellent quality I definitely recommend this phone, it won't let you down.",0.9942,0.244,0.024,0.732,Positive
"This is my first time in forever consistently using a phone other than iPhones but I love this phone. I love the design of the phone and all of its features. It’s easy to manage the apps and settings to set the phone up how I would like it. The battery life has lasted for a bit but I haven’t been on it much for it to drain. The camera quality was top tier, at least in my opinion. I’m still exploring the phone but I love everything about it so far, I would definitely recommend this!",0.9892,0.297,0.0,0.703,Positive
"I love this phone. It has amazing security features and the phone is made to make life easier. I've always been a Samsung girl but Google may have me if they continue to make amazing phones. The pictures are of amazing quality, love the AI photo generator. Honestly I could go on and on. I've already dropped it but it proved to be pretty durable. Good battery life but one thing I didn't like is the 2 sided C charger it comes with which has led me to keep using my other charger.",0.9885,0.32,0.023,0.657,Positive
"This phone is great!! I've always been a Samsung Galaxy user and the Google Pixel is super user friendly, more intuitive even than the Galaxy. The camera is amazing!!

"The camera is a standout—it handles low-light shots exceptionally well, and colors look natural without being over-processed. Google’s AI features, like magic eraser and photo unblur, make quick edits super easy and genuinely useful. The display is sharp and smooth, with a high refresh rate that makes streaming and scrolling feel responsive. Battery life holds up well, generally lasting through the day, and charging is quick enough to keep up if needed.

Overall, it’s a powerful phone with impressive features, especially if you’re into photography and already use Google’s ecosystem.",0.9778,0.267,0.0,0.733,Positive
"A very cool phone! I'm an iOS user, but I like this phone, its concise size. It connects to your iPhone and, if anything, serves as a spare phone. As a UX creator, I need a good phone camera, the Google phone camera seemed faded to me. So he's not right for my job. But otherwise, it's great because it keeps the battery for up to two days! It is fast in operation and performs all the necessary functions. I'm going to give it to my father-in-law because he has a regular push-button phone that I can't send him a photo of his grandson lol. But I would recommend having such a phone",0.9722,0.187,0.0,0.813,Positive

"This pixel nine Pro is quite responsive has an excellent modem, has a screen better than the iPhone and photography better than iPhone. The pixel is also less expensive and has more consistent updates. There are several additional features are unavailable on iPhone, which in my experience are quite superior. It has long lasting battery life as well. The form factor is excellent in the phone is significantly lighter than the larger iPhone. The screen is excellent and higher resolution. The photo processing features are superior. Android has incredible flexibility in user experience and several add-ons are now present. The Gemini is surprisingly useful in multiple applications and there are excellent guides to help you make these features useful. The privacy concerns when using Google environment have been mitigated. The privacy dashboard is quite specific and much more simple than was seen previously. You are not forced to use the keyboard, or Google Chrome. The AI features even improves things like the weather app, allows image creation in pixel studio, significantly improves, photo editing, and photo 
composition and has an interesting summarize your call feature which automatically takes notes after announcing it presence. Other actual useful additions include screenshot application and several Google applications, which are now superior to their iPhone counterparts.",0.9964,0.266,0.0,0.734,Positive
"As an iPhone girl - I’m actually impressed with this phone. Genuinely. It’s got a good weight and size to it. I previously had an iPhone 13 mini, and while this phone is bigger it doesn’t feel monstrous. It’s sleek, it takes great pictures (admittedly better than my iPhone) and it looks nice. I would have no problem trading in my snobby blue texts for green texts for this phone. I did minus one star - I have hardly anything loaded on the phone so far and it was overheating just sending text messages. Which is a little concerning, given that should be an easy task.  It also froze up a few times when texting or taking photos. Overall, I’ll happily continue to use it and the overall phone is great. Just a few bugs that need to be worked out.",0.9628,0.171,0.049,0.779,Positive
"The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a pretty nice smartphone. 

One of the things I immediately loved about it is that there’s no bloatware installed—it’s a clean and efficient experience right out of the box. A

And the transfer process was fast and activating the phone was the easiest I’ve ever experienced. It only took a few clicks, and I didn’t even have to enter SIM numbers.

For photos, the Pixel 9 Pro is a bit of a mixed bag. The photo quality is good, but compared to my previous Android, the normal photos didn’t quite measure up. That said, the photo editing features are phenomenal—definitely a step above what other Android phones offer.

One downside for me is the base storage. The 128GB model just doesn’t cut it for my needs. In my opinion, 256GB should really be the minimum standard these days, especially for a flagship phone like this.

On the positive side, the UI is very customizable, which was a pleasant surprise. I had a lot of fun using the AI tools to create my own background and tweaking the color scheme to my liking. That kind of personalization adds a nice touch. However, I don’t understand why the Google search widget at the bottom of the home screen is immovable. It’s frustrating, and I wish they’d allow more flexibility there.

The display is fantastic—vibrant and smooth—and the charging capabilities are top-notch. The phone charges incredibly fast and the battery lasts seemingly forever. That’s a major win for anyone who’s always on the go.

I think there may be a big as when I read a text and replied, the text thread remains bold and unread for about 2 seconds. I updated the software and rebooted and this still happens. A minor annoyance but not a huge deal. 

I also love that the phone has crash detection and satellite SOS enabled. These safety features really need to become standard on all smartphones and I'm so glad the Google Pixel 9 series phones have these features.

Overall, I do like the phone. While there are a few quirks and areas for improvement, it’s still an impressive device for anyone looking for a flagship experience.",0.997,0.224,0.054,0.723,Positive
"With Google's robust marketing campaign across social media and television for the Pixel 9 Pro, I've been surrounded by the hype!

As someone who has always been loyal to Samsung flagship devices, I couldn't help but feel tempted by the enticing promises offered by Google. I was excited to spend some time with the Pixel 9 Pro and see whether I would stick with Samsung or venture into a new path.

The phone's satisfying weight feels just right in my hand, and its dimensions are nicely balanced—not too bulky. However, I did notice that it can slip out of my grip quite easily without a case. Having had the device ""get away from me"" a few times, I can confidently say it holds up well to wear and tear.

The Google Pixel 9 Pro feels fresh and unique compared to most phones released this year. Upon its arrival, I was immediately taken by its sleek design, exceptional cameras, and remarkable new AI features. It has shown to be a formidable rival to my Samsung Galaxy S22.

Camera:
Images look great in all kinds of lighting, and the AI enhancements, such as Pixel Studio, add to the overall experience. However, images are not quite as vivid as with my Samsung. The video quality is excellent.


Battery life:
Top tier, even with heavy content creation use, I could get through most of the day without charging. Charging time is zippy.
 
Design: The Google Pixel 9 Pro is a testament to its sleek, premium design. Its 'Hazel' color, a sophisticated green-greige, adds a modern touch to its appearance. Holding it, I couldn't help but be impressed. The lens bar at the back of the device enhances its aesthetics.



Interface: Less bloated than Samsung.

Software: The Android experience is relatively smooth, offering the latest features and rapid updates due to Google's direct access to the operating system. However, as a long-time Android user of Samsung devices, I noticed that many of the features on the Pixel 9 Pro were already available to me. Additionally, several Google products with the Pixel 9 Pro are not new to other Android users who regularly install updates.

The Pixel 9 features a new AI assistant called Gemini, which promises to offer advanced assistance. One notable component is ""Gemini Live,"" a mobile conversational experience that allows users to engage in fluid conversations with Gemini. However, this feature is only available to Gemini Advanced subscribers. Personally, I have no interest in casually chatting with AI chatbots, so Gemini does not appeal to me as a selling point.

Speaker volume: It has good depth, nice bass, and is less tinny than my Samsung. However, the maximum volume could be higher.

Overall, the Pixel 9 Pro is a strong option if you're in the market for a new phone that meets all your needs in terms of design and technology. However, it doesn't stand out enough for me to consider switching from my Samsung Galaxy devices, which offer comparable features and quality.",0.9982,0.178,0.014,0.809,Positive
This phone is perfect and classier  from the solid built which encase all this new technology to the swiftness in which it reacts.

The screen while not being the largest still allows for total clarity and visual ease. Google have outdone themselves and have really shown up and out with this new device.,0.9607,0.218,0.0,0.782,Positive

I have had an iPhone for the last 4 or so years and have slowly started to look into other options when my battery started to decline fast. The google pixel 9 pro has a great battery life so far.

"This review is coming from someone that has been using a pixel phone for the past 15 years. Also, I was using a pixel 8 before I made this update to the pixel 9 Pro. Software wise. It's pretty seamless. Moving all of my apps and data and files from my pixel 8 to this pixel 9 Pro was incredibly easy. Everything is really well integrated and while it did take some time because I have a lot of photos and videos, it did in one go without any issues. Everything is so smooth on the pixel 9 Pro. It runs so fast. The screen looks absolutely amazing, and my favorite feature is of course the camera on the pro. It's absolutely stunning and the videos only get better and better with every iteration of the pixel. I can't wait to try this out to its full capacity.

Lightweight and easy to set up.  The swipe motions aren't exactly intuitive which makes the absence of a home button a bit more difficult.  Screen looks great.,0.6378,0.22,0.088,0.692,Positive
"Okay, seriously, this Pixel 9 Pro is the bomb. To be clear, my last pixel was the OG pixel, prior to that the nexus 6p. After that i have owned oneplus 6T, 7T pro mclaren and most recently 9 pro. They have been fantastic phones and overall i cannot complain, however one thing i find lacking with the 1+ has always been the camera. With the pixel, I was blown away by the camera the second I unboxed it. The pictures are just stunning! Like, seriously, the detail is insane, and it takes incredible photos even in the dark. I have included multiple examples of this. I am not much into video so i cannot comment on this vs say the iphone.   
The phone itself is super snappy and responsive. I haven't experienced any lag at all, which is a huge plus. I was worried about the tensor especially coming from my snapdragon. No drop off at all. I will say, i do feel that candybar phones have plateaued in that if you have a recent flagship, it probably has capable hardware to last another 5 years without feeling outdated. I do not feel an insane increase in smoothness with the pixel compared to mye 1+ but that is because the plus was also spec’d out even 3 years ago. The biggest difference with the pixel is the battery life which was  a total game-changer. I can easily make it through a full day of heavy use without even thinking about charging. I usually have about 50% due to how efficient the pixel software is with “pure android”. 
And let's talk about the display. It's absolutely gorgeous. Super bright, vibrant colors, and it's just a joy to look at. I love how it feels in my hand too – it's big enough for a great viewing experience, but still comfortable to hold and use one-handed. This was a big departure from my usual inclination towards XL versions.
The software is really clean and intuitive. I'm a big Google Assistant fan, and it's seamlessly integrated into the phone. My entire house is set up with android tv, lights, garage and it is extremely nice to be able to have my phone at the center of all that in conjunction with the google home speakers. Overall, I'm seriously impressed with this phone. It's definitely one of the best I've ever used and i feel privileged to have been able to daily it for 2 months now""

Caveats: i do not game on my phone and as such i cannot tell you how the tensor chip performs compared to SD.

I also think even though the phone performs well, i am not sure how “future proof” it is because the specs are a bit underwhelming. Basically, it works well now, but unlike my 1+ that still seems to be going on strong other than battery, im not sure if this phone is hardware proof for the next 5 years especially for the price.",0.9986,0.211,0.035,0.755,Positive
